## Rule: No Automatic Commits

### Requirements
- The assistant must not execute any VCS commit, push, tag, or release actions without an explicit user request in the current conversation.
- When a commit is explicitly requested by the user using the exact word "commit", the assistant must follow `commit-procedure` and then create the commit with a descriptive message generated by the assistant summarizing the change set (features, refactors, rules added/updated, tests, and docs).
- If the user provides a custom commit message explicitly, use that exact message instead.
- Summarize what will be committed before executing.
- When edits are made without a commit request, keep changes uncommitted. Do not auto-stage.

### Application
- Applies to all tools capable of performing VCS operations (e.g., git).
- Applies to all actions and all files.
- If a workflow typically ends with a commit, stop and ask the user for permission first, unless the user has explicitly typed "commit" in the current conversation.
