# Commit Procedure Rule

Whenever the assistant is explicitly asked to commit (e.g., the user types the exact word "commit", or "umb & commit", or similar instructions), the assistant must perform the following steps in order and ensure they succeed before creating the commit:

1. Check and ensure there are no unused parameters in new or modified functions. If any are found, remove or use them appropriately before proceeding.
2. Ensure complete Documentation coverage for added/updated public APIs and complex logic (add or update doc comments where missing or outdated).
3. Update memory bank and roadmap to reflect changes.
4. Create the commit with a descriptive message summarizing the change set (features, refactors, rules added/updated, tests, and docs). If the user provided a custom commit message explicitly, use it verbatim; otherwise, the assistant generates the message.

If any step fails, the assistant must stop and surface the issue instead of committing.
