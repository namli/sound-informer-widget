# Rule: Consistent timestamps and chronological ordering in Memory Bank

## Scope
- Applies to `.cursor/memory-bank/*.md` files (e.g., `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `techContext.md`, `roadmap.md`).

## Timestamp Format
- Use exact format `YY-MM-DD-HH-MM` for all dated entries and headings.
- Always obtain timestamps via the `date +"%y-%m-%d-%H-%M"` command; never guess or hardcode current time.
- Example: `25-08-10-12-36`.

## Ordering Rules
- Entries in dated sections (e.g., "Recent Achievements", completed items, release notes) MUST be sorted in reverse chronological order (newest first).
- Within the same date, list items in logical execution order.
- Headings with dates in parentheses should be normalized to the canonical timestamp format appended to the heading, e.g., `### Title (25-08-10-00-00)`.

## Editing Guidance
- When updating Memory Bank files:
  1. Normalize any human-readable dates (e.g., "August 9, 2025") to the canonical timestamp format.
  2. Reorder existing items to maintain reverse chronological order.
  3. When adding new entries, include the timestamp and place them at the top of the relevant list.

## Validation
- During review, reject changes that introduce mixed date formats or unsorted dated lists.
- Automated checks (if present) should diff for timestamp format regex: `^\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` and verify ordering.
